# Path System Smoothness Improvements

This document describes the improvements made to the PathClass.lua to address trail ruggedness and rendering issues.

## Problem Statement
The original path system created trails that appeared rugged and rendered weirdly at certain parts, particularly when moving the Brush along circular paths.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Index clamping** at endpoints caused discontinuities
2. **Uniform parameterization** in Catmull-Rom splines caused loops/overshoots
3. **Insufficient smoothing** with only 1 Chaikin iteration
4. **Poor tangent estimation** in wave functions with too small delta
5. **Close point spacing** (1 stud minimum) created jagged segments
6. **Lack of curvature awareness** in sampling

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Centripetal Parameterization (Enabled by Default)
```lua
centripetal = true  -- Prevents loops and overshoots
```
- Uses distance-based parameterization instead of uniform spacing
- Much more stable for uneven point distributions
- Eliminates visual artifacts in curved sections

### 2. Increased Minimum Point Distance
```lua
minDist = 2.5  -- Increased from 1.0
```
- Reduces number of very close points that cause jaggedness
- Better spacing for smoother interpolation

### 3. Enhanced Chaikin Smoothing
```lua
iterations = 2  -- Increased from 1
```
- More aggressive corner-cutting produces smoother curves
- Applied before resampling for optimal results

### 4. Improved Wave Function Stability
```lua
delta = 0.01  -- Increased from 0.001
```
- More stable tangent estimation
- Added zero-vector checks to prevent instability
- Better perpendicular vector calculation

### 5. Adaptive Sampling Based on Curvature
- Analyzes path curvature during resampling
- Adds extra points in high-curvature areas (>0.3 radians)
- Maintains detail where it matters most

### 6. Better Endpoint Handling
- Extrapolates control points instead of clamping indices
- Prevents discontinuities at path start/end
- Smoother transitions at boundaries

### 7. Robust Input Processing
- Removes duplicate points closer than 0.1 studs
- Validates all input points before processing
- Prevents degenerate cases that cause artifacts

### 8. Fixed Brush Offset Issue (NEW)
- **FIXED**: Ensures exact passage through control points while maintaining smooth curves
- Modified GetPointAt() to detect when parameter t corresponds to a control point
- Enhanced wave function to have zero effect at control points  
- Added tolerance checks to guarantee brush hits all specified path points
- Maintains circular/oval/flowy shape between control points through improved Catmull-Rom interpolation
- Prevents wave and noise effects from affecting control point accuracy

## Configuration Options

The PATH_CONFIG table allows easy tuning:

```lua
local PATH_CONFIG = {
    noiseAmount = 0,      -- Organic randomness (0 = smooth)
    tension = 0.5,        -- Curve tightness (0 = loose, 1 = tight)
    centripetal = true,   -- Stable interpolation (recommended)
    waveAmplitude = 0.5,  -- Wave effect strength
    waveFrequency = 2,    -- Wave cycles per path
    wavePhase = 1,        -- Wave offset
}
```

## Expected Results

1. **Smoother circular paths** without jagged edges
2. **More stable trail rendering** for moving objects
3. **Better handling** of uneven point distributions
4. **Reduced visual artifacts** at path endpoints
5. **Consistent quality** regardless of input spacing
6. **Exact brush placement** through all control points (NEW)
7. **Preserved smooth curves** between control points

## Testing Recommendations

To verify improvements:
1. Create circular paths with varying point densities
2. Test paths with sharp turns and gentle curves
3. Verify smooth trail rendering during object movement
4. Check endpoint behavior for looped and open paths

## Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible. Existing code will automatically benefit from the improvements without modification.
